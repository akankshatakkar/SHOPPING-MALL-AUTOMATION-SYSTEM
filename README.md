# SHOPPING-MALL-AUTOMATION-SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION
The project is on Shopping Mall Billing. Supermarket is the place where customers come to purchase their daily using products and pay for that. So there is a need to calculate how many products are sold and to generate the bill for the customer.
“Shopping Mall Automation System” aims at developing into software that can be used at places like Shopping malls, Super markets to easily maneuver the daily tasks of taking the order, calculating the bill etc.

The main advantage of this project is that it converts all the manual work which is time consuming and error prone to fully automated system which helps in eliminating all the paper work, saves time, improves customer services. It also speeds up various processes such as addition of new items to the menu, modification of details of items and calculation of bills thus providing convenience to the workers as well as customers.

In the development of the project, selection of an appropriate programming language and a platform is of primary importance. The major part of the credit goes to the software environment chosen by the developer. Selection of a language from the ocean of languages is very difficult; a developer has to consider various features and functionalities that a particular language can provide.
In this project C++ language is used to maintain all the data. It provides many features like file handling, data can be easily maintained and many features that are required while doing a project.
